Assignment 3

this code compiles to six binaries:

objget
objput
objlist
objgetacl
objsetacl * note an ACL or user file is malformed if it has any trailing newlines.
objtestacl

the permissions make target sets the permissions on all of the binaries and on the repository.
the reset_repo make target resets the data in the repository and sets up the permissions

obj* are all documented in their usages and in the pgm0.txt and pgm1.txt and pgm2.txt.

In my last assignment I said that I a lot of the code was messy.  This assignment didn't fix any of that, but didn't make anything worse.  All hashing and encryption were done in three patch functions in the utils namespace (md5, read_encrypted, write_encrypted) and then implemented in a few lines in objget and objput.

I have a few tests to test writing with and without a passphrase.  I haven't gone back to fix my test suite though.
