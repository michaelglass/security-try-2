Assignment 2

this code compiles to six binaries:

objget
objput
objlist
objgetacl
objsetacl * note an ACL or user file is malformed if it has any trailing newlines.
objtestacl

the permissions make target sets the permissions on all of the binaries and on the repository.
the reset_repo make target resets the data in the repository and sets up the permissions

obj* are all documented in their usages and in the pgm0.txt and pgm1.txt.

This assignment was much less clean and more quickly done than assignments 0 and 1.  A lot of the design decisions came down to what could be done the quickest, and so a lot of unstructured patch-and-fix code was added to the code from assignment 1 which I was satisfied with.  Furthermore, unit testing across accounts is something I didn't not learn how to do:  all testing has been use testing.

The entire program runs suid'd to a user (not root), and the files are stored in a repository owned by the binary owner whose file permissions are 700.  Any other users can't break through the 700-permission'd directory except by using the accessor applications.
